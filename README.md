# Depression Detection through Text and Video

## Overview
This project implements a system to detect signs of depression using both textual and video data. By leveraging natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision techniques, the system can analyze user-generated text and facial expressions to provide insights into mental health.

---

## Features
- **Text Analysis:**
  - Sentiment analysis of user-submitted text.
  - Detection of depressive language patterns.
- **Video Analysis:**
  - Facial expression recognition using computer vision.
  - Analysis of micro-expressions and body language.
- **Multimodal Integration:**
  - Combines text and video analysis for more accurate predictions.
- **Report Generation:**
  - Generates a report summarizing the analysis results.
